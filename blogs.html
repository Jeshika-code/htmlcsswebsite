                    <H2>HTML5 CSS3</h2>
                    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of every website. The use of HTML is required for the development of a website. The HTML5 version is currently popular. It is the most recent enhanced version of HTML, with semantic tags such as article,section,aside,footer, and so on. We can also build our website layout entirely in HTML, but the website will be less engaging, beautiful, and interactive for end users. As a result, CSS is required as well.</p>
                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) improves the look of your website. We can use CSS to change font size, text alignment, colors, background images, and other elements. CSS has a plethora of capabilities that can be used to improve the appeal and interest of our website. CSS3 is the most recent and improved version of CSS, with many new features such as the box-shadow property, advanced animation, opacity, and selectors.</p>

                    <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
                    <P >SYou can use JavaScript to create dynamic interactivity on your website.JavaScript is a client-side and server-side scripting language. It’s all about using the developer’s programming logic to create an interactive website. If you want to show the date and time on your website with regular updates, you can use JS.JavaScript allows web pages to update themselves dynamically, but the logic for doing this is solely up to you.</P>
                    <P>JavaScript can also be used for online games, client-side validation, displaying a drop-down menu in a webpage, slideshows, animations, and so on. In general, JS is utilized to improve the functionality of your website.
                        JavaScript gives you complete control over web browsers, as well as servers and databases. JavaScript is used by databases like CouchDB, MongoDB, and RethinkDB.</P>
                
                    <h2>VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM</h2>
                    <P>The version control system makes collaboration easy and productive, especially when we’re working as a team. It keeps track of every update and maintains the code’s performance. Because we need to work in a team and each developer needs to upload their source code and make changes, the version control system has shown to be incredibly efficient in web development.
                        <br>The most used version control system is GIT. GIT is free, open-source software that makes collaboration simple and easy to maintain. If you are a web developer, you must learn how to utilize GIT.</P>
                        <h2>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</h2>
                    <p>The fundamental purpose of SEO is to drive visitors to your website. It causes your website to rank better in Google or any other search engine, resulting in increased user interaction and views of your site. <br>Front-end developers must study and apply various SEO strategies to their websites.
                        SEO-friendly aspects such as clear, clean, and optimized URLs, the usage of meta tags, mobile-friendly design (responsive), links, photos, and so on must be incorporated into developers' websites. Employing alt tags in photos and using small images attracts a lot of traffic.</p>
                    <h2>WEB PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION</h2>
                    <p>When your website is finished and ready to be viewed in browsers, developers must not overlook Web Performance Optimization. WPO is all about web performance. The smoothness with which your website operates is referred to as web performance.</p>
                    <p> What is the speed of your website, and how well does it serve end-users?</p>
                    <p>If your website’s contents take too long to load or if scrolling is not smooth, it is evident that your website will not be interesting to end-users. This will have an impact on your website’s audience and lower traffic. As a developer, you must concentrate on WPO and learn how to balance website performance.
                    <br> Reducing HTTP requests, Gzip compression, caching, utilizing fewer plugins, and image optimization can all help you improve website performance.</p>
                    <h2>CROSS-BROWSER TESTING</h2>
                    <p >Cross-browser testing ensures that your website’s appearance remains consistent across browsers. Some of the common browser testing tools that developers can use to test their website in different browsers include Lambda test, QA Wolf, and browser shots.</p> 
                    <h2>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h2>
                    <P>If you are a web developer, simply creating a website that works on your PC/Desktop is insufficient. The website’s appearance varies depending on the device. When you access your website on a PC, the screen size is larger than on mobile devices. It is vital to make your website responsive so that it looks excellent and appealing regardless of the device used to view it.</P>
